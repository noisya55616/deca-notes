These PI's are mostly found in MC.

### Performance Element: Understand fundamental economic concepts to obtain a foundation for employment in business.

#### Performance Indicators:

* Distinguish between economic goods and services (EC:002) (CS)

Goods are a physical item while services are activities of performing work for others.
Goods are tangible, can be patented and are easily compared, while servies are intangible, cannot be patented and cannot be easy compared.

* Explain the concept of economic resources (EC:003) (CS)

Economic resources are resources available to a company.
This includes *capital*, like factories and equipment, *land*, which includes real estate and the natural resources on the land, *labour*, which is human resources, and *entrepreneurship*, which is skill involving risk-taking to set up enterprises.

* Describe the concepts of economics and economic activities (EC:001) (CS)

Economic activities are actions that involve the production, purchase, and selling of goods and services.
This includes: ***buying, manufacturing, selling, investing, transporting***.

* Determine economic utilities created by business activities (EC:004) (CS)

Economic utilites are attributes of a product or service that can satisfy a customer.
The economic utilities are form, information, time, place and possession.

**Form** utility is the conversion of raw materials into useful product for the customer. 
**Information** utility is the communication process where customers are informed about the business's products.
**Time** utility is providing the customer's want at the time of the desire of the consumer.
**Place** utility is providing convenient access to products.
**Possession** utility is transferring ownership of an item to the customer.

* Explain the principles of supply and demand (EC:005) (CS)

Supply is how much a product is available and demand is how much desire there is for a product.
The Law of Supply says that at higher prices, buyers will demand less of an economic good.
The Law of Demand says that at higher prices, suppliers will supply more of an economic good.
High supply and low demand means a low price, and vice versa.
Equilibrium price is the price where a supplier can sell as many units as they produce and a buyer can buy as many units as he wants.

* Describe the functions of prices in markets (EC:006) (CS)

The function of price in the economy is as a signal for changes in the market and to determine efficient distribution of resources in a market system.
For example, high prices can indicate a product is in shortage, while lower prices may indicate a surplus.
Low prices due to a surplus can signal customers to buy more and suppliers to supply less, for example.
Consider the context.

### Performance Element: Understand the nature of business to show its contributions to society.

#### Performance Indicators:

* Explain the role of business in society (EC:070) (CS)

The role of business in society is to fulfill the needs and demands of a society through the distribution of foods and services.
Again, always consider case context. Tie it in to something.

* Describe types of business activities (EC:071) (CS)

There are 3 types of business activities.
***Operating*** is activities directly relating to the creation of goods and services.
***Investing*** is activities relating to capital expenditures which is in relation to money spent on obtaining fixed assets.
***Financing*** is obtaining funds: this includes funds paid out as dividends, share repurchases as well as interest.

* Explain the organizational design of businesses (EC:103) (SP)
* Discuss the global environment in which businesses operate (EC:104) (SP)
* Describe factors that affect the business environment (EC:105) (SP)

### Performance Element: Understand economic systems to be able to recognize the environments in which businesses function.

#### Performance Indicators:

* Explain the types of economic systems (EC:007) (CS)

There are 4 main types of economic systems.
***Traditional*** economic systems are based on tradition and already existing systems, as well as cultural values and customs.
There is often a large reliance on barter, and there is usually little centralized government control.
This is usually in rural communities or less economically developed countries: think rural Africa or Asia, that type of area.

***Command*** economic systems are completely controlled by a central government.
The government controls and determines prices, goods produced and what is sold.
This usually occurs in Communist regimes: North Korea, former Soviet Union, mid-1900's China.

***Market*** economic systems have very little government control, and the condition of the market is determined completely by the individuals and businesses within it.
This usually attempts to stop the government from having massive power over the economy, or in general.
Think America.

***Mixed*** economic systems are in place in most economically developed countries like Canada, and are a combination of Command and Market systems.
Individuals control the market, but the government still regulates the economy in some way.

* Identify the impact of small business/entrepreneurship on market economies (EC:065) (CS)

They bring growth and innovation to local economies where thye are established.
They also stimulate the economy by providing employment to people who are not employed/unemployable by larger corporations.

* Explain the concept of private enterprise (EC:009) (CS)

It's a business or industry that is managed by independen companies or people rather than the state.

* Identify factors affecting a business's profit (EC:010) (CS)

There are a few main ones:
***Number of production units, productivity per unit, direct costs, value per unit, enterprise mix, and overhead costs.***

But there are many other to consider, jsut think.

* Determine factors affecting business risk (EC:011) (CS)

Business risk has a lot of factors affecting it.
There are a few main categories.
***Human*** risk comes from people: employees or customers shoplifting, vandalization, employees being dishonest, all that.
***Economic*** risk comes from economic factors. 
This can be the current overall economic environment, competition with another business, or any number of other factors.
***Natural*** business risk comes from natural factors: natural disasters, pandemics, that sort of thing.
This is a good place to pull some stuff out of your ass, make some plausible stuff up.
Choose an important concept and attach risk to it: strategic risk, risk related to business plan, compliance risk related to compliance with laws and regulations, financial risk related to financing your business, all that works.
Make a diagram, maybe, a triangle with 3 types of risk on it, a 4-square, any of these. 
And ALWAYS use case context.

* Explain the concept of competition (EC:012) (CS)

Competition occurs when businesses are selling similar products that satisfy the same consumer need.
Direct competition is when businesses are selling products that are essentiially the same, while indirect competition occurs when 2 companies sell different products that still satisfy the same or similar customer needs.
For example, laptop manufacturers are in direct competition with each other, as they all sell basically the same time, while desktop PC manufacturers are in indirect competition, as they both satisfy the same or similar customer need, but are still different products.
They still affect each other: for example, desktop PC sales are slightly undermined by laptop sales because some people buy laptops instead of desktop PCs.

This one is always going to be very case specific.
