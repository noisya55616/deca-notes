In general, there are a few main types of business ownership.

Sole proprietorship means there is one person owning the business, and this person is personally liable for everything in the business. 
Generally this is for people who both own the business and are the business.
This person pays business taxes through a personal income tax return.
Usually it's one person overall with control over decision making.
It's usually smaller or solo businesses that do this.

General partnership is similar to sole proprietorship but with 2 or more people owning the business. 
It can be up to 20 of them.
Each partner controls the enterprise and shares in the profits and losses of the company.
Usually each partner pays partnership taxes through personal tax returns in proportion to their share of ownership.
There is not too much need for published accountability, and decision making powers depend on the terms of agreement.
This usually happens with lawyers and medical practice.
Remember all the law shows: "making partner", and all that.

Incorporation is generally what is done with larger businesses.
It has shareholders and a board that control the actions of he company.
The shareholders on the company and have limited liability. Partners contribute to capital, and decision making depends on agreement signed.
Private companies are known as ***private limited companies***, as opposed to ***publicly traded companies***.
Publicly traded companies usually have many many owners who own shares listed on exchanges.
Shareholders usually vote at AGM to decide on the board of directors and dividends to pay.
