A ***tort*** is a civil wrong, that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, and results in legal libaility for whoever did it.
The harm can be in the form of emotional distress, financial losses, and many other things. It usually isn't criminal.


*Business* torts are civil wrongs committed by or against an organization. It often involves harm done to a business's intangible assets, like intellectual property or client relationships. 

There is also breach of fiduciary duty. A fiduciary is a party who is charged with acting in the best interest of another party. If a fiduciary acts in a way that damages the best interests of who or what is represents, then that is a tort. 

For example, if a director of a company, who has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the company, starts a different company and steals a contract from the first company, that is a breach of fiduciary duty. 

Businesses that commit a tort can be taken to court and be sued.
