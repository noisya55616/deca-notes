# Instructional Area: Customer Relations (CR)

## Standard: Understands the techniques and strategies used to foster positive, ongoing relationships with customers

### Performance Element: Foster positive relationships with customers to enhance company image.

#### Performance Indicators:

* Explain the nature of positive customer relations (CR:003) (CS)

On the nature or positive customer relations, discuss stuff like how it benefits your business. E.g. positive image and positioning in the minds of current and potential customers, increased customer loyalty, that sort of thing.

* Demonstrate a customer-service mindset (CR:004) (CS)

Customer-service mindset is prioritizing treating customers and providing the best possible service to customers.

* Develop rapport with customers (CR:029) (CS)

Building a rapport is about what it sounds like. Talk to the customer, make them feel comfortable, guide them to make the best decision, cutesy stuff like that.

* Reinforce service orientation through communication (CR:005) (CS)

A service orientation is a focus on the quality and value of the service you provide. This should be pretty easy to think and talk about, just think like a shill.

* Respond to customer inquiries (CR:006) (CS)

In responding to customer inquiries, make sure to think it through, think about the context of the case and what your judge/customer really aims to find out. Think a bit deeper than the question it self: maybe in the context of the case it means that your financing plans are difficult for customers to understand, so you need to edit or help explain things.

* Adapt communication to the cultural and social differences among clients (CR:019) (CS)

Think this one through. It should be pretty easy though: anything important will be told to you in the case. Plan accordingly.

* Interpret business policies to customers/clients (CR:007) (CS)

In this one, remember the context of the case, and see what your customers aim to find out or are confused about. Is it something specific? Tailor your response with this context.

* Build and maintain relationships with customers (CR:030) (SP)

This one should be pretty self explanatory when you see it, take it in the context of the case.

### Performance Element: Resolve conflicts with/for customers to encourage repeat business.

#### Performance Indicators:

* Handle difficult customers (CR:009) (CS)
* Handle customer/client complaints (CR:010) (CS)

These should be self-explanatory in the context of your case. Take context into account for everything, tie it in to your specific case for the points. Don't think too hard on it.

### Performance Element: Reinforce company's image to exhibit the company's brand promise.

#### Performance Indicators:

* Identify company's brand promise (CR:001) (CS)

This one is about case context, but remember to think slightly bigger picture here. Don't think TOO hard though, it's usually pretty simple: provide the best service, provide the quickest service, etc.

* Determine ways of reinforcing the company's image through employee performance (CR:002) (CS)

This will depend on the context of the case, but it's about what it sounds like. Maybe you want to reinforce that your company aims to make things simple and easy, so you instruct your employees to ensure that customers have this kind of experience in some way.
