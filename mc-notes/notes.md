# Notes

Unit pricing is price per unit, e.g. $23 per kilogram, $2 per pound, etc.

Upselling is suggestion selling, not post sale opportunities.

Businesses tend to focus on personal selling rather than promotion. B2B marketing involves selling goods and services to other businesses and organizations. Effective B2B marketers understand that businesses' needs and wants differ from final consumers. B2B marketing tends to focus on personal selling. This is because businesses often purchase complex or expensive equipment for their operations. In addition, after-the-sale service is important to businesses because they often need installation, repair, and maintenance services for their purchases. Business purchases often involve multiple decision makers. Professional buyers—those who purchase goods and services for businesses/organizations— tend to have extensive knowledge about the products that they buy and sell. Consumers, on the other hand, must often seek information from their peers or experts.

Commercialization. Test marketing involves introducing a new product to a limited market to determine what its acceptance will be. If the test market accepts the product, it is ready for commercialization. Commercialization is the point at which a product goes into full-scale production, the marketing plan is put in place, service and sales training are done, and the product's life cycle begins. Product innovation is the process of generating product ideas. After screening ideas and determining the feasibility of a specific idea or item, the business develops a prototype, which is an early model or sample of the item. Modification is altering an existing product.

Physical form and features. Positioning a product according to the function it performs is the same as positioning by physical form and features. This is different from positioning by benefits because benefits are what a customer gets from the product, rather than just what the product is. Positioning by manufacturing or creation process means focusing on how the product was made. Positioning by reliability means focusing on how dependable the product is.

Hidden benefit. A hidden benefit is an advantage that cannot be seen or understood without the assistance of a salesperson. A customer won't know about the benefit of a computer's two-year warranty unless the salesperson tells him/her. Obvious (or apparent) benefits are advantages that need little explanation by the salesperson—the customer already knows, or can easily recognize, the benefit. A warranty is not necessarily a unique feature of a computer. A customer characteristic is not the same as a hidden benefit.
