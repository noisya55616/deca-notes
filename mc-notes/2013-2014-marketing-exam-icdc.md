## Questions I got wrong

*What I selected*

**The right answer**

1. Which of the following is an oligopoly:

* **A. Oil industry**
* B. Apparel industry
* C. Food-service industry
* *D. Computer industry*

I guess it's that there are many many players in the computer industry, while there are only a few big ones in the oil industry.
That makes a lot of sense, actually.

2. When a local athletic apparel store sells shoes, clothing, and accessories that are designed specifically for runners, it is using ____________ segmentation.

* A. geographic
* **B. psychographic**
* *C. demographic*
* D. rate of usage

Psychographics and demographics are different things for different purposes.

Demographics are the quantifiable statistics of any particular population. 

Psychographics are the study of values, personality, lifestyle, opinions and interests of people of a certain community.

Demographics are quantitative., while psychographics are qualitative.

Demographics includes things such as age, mobility, race, and gender, while psychographics includes things like opinions on objects and issues, political views and addiliation, personality and lifestyle.

7. Which of the following is an idea-generation technique that uses programmed thinking:

* A. Forced questioning
* *B. Mind mapping*
* **C. Attribute listing**
* D. Synectics

Progammed thinking is a structured or logical framework for thinking and idea-generation.
Brainstorming is usually listing out any ideas that come spontaneously to the participants while attribute listing is more structured.

16. When using the systematic random sampling method, marketers must determine the

* **A. skip interval.**
* B. stratum.
* *C. cluster.*
* D. quota gap.

Systematic sampling is sampling by selecting, say, every 100th person from a population of 10000 to survey. To do this you need a skip interval that will select a sufficiently random population.

18. Fairlawn Manufacturing will replace or repair the motor of its Cut-rite riding lawnmower for one year after the purchase date. This is an example of a(n)

* **A. limited warranty.**
* B. full warranty.
* C. unconditional guarantee.
* *D. service guarantee.*

A limited guarantee is a written undertaking to fulfill a specific obligation. Ordinarily, a limited guarantee is restricted in its application to a single transaction. A limited guarantee is limited to the amount, time, or type of loss.

26. A marketing survey revealed that four out of seven residents in the greater metro area prefer Lupi's Pizza to Morelli's Pizza and Renaldo's Pizza. What measure of central tendency does this example represent?

* **A. Mode**
* *B. Mean*
* C. Range
* D. Scope

This is just a mistake, no need to delve deep into it.

27. While filling out a customer-satisfaction survey, Ashley is asked to rank her level of agreement with the statement, "The sales representative was friendly and courteous." Out of the five options presented, Ashley's response is "strongly agree." This is an example of a _________ rating scale.

* **A. Likert**

Likert scales are rating scales that usually have 5-7 balanced responses, along with a neutral one.

For example: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree

32. When a government regulatory agency accuses a company of running a deceptive advertisement, the company voluntarily agrees to stop running the ad without admitting guilt. In this situation, the remedy used is

A consent order or consent decree is an agreement/settlement that resolves a dispute between 2 parties without admission of guilt or liability (in criminal and civil cases respectively).

37. What component of a print advertisement contains the sales message?

* A. Illustration
* **B. Copy**
* C. Tag line
* *D. Headline*

You start with a headline that grabs attention, then go to copy that communicates in a clear and concise way a message.

46. The Upper Crust Bread Shop bakes its bread on site so that customers can smell the bread when they enter the shop, and it sets baskets of bread samples throughout the shop. The shop uses these touch points to carry out its

* A. operations-management processes.
* B. product-development tactics.
* C. **customer-experience management strategies.**
* D. *brand-insistence advertising techniques.*

I guess this is kind of self explanatory. 
They are managing the experience of customers in the shop. it's not really advertisement.

* 49. Which of the following is an example of a business that uses product class as a positioning strategy:

* A. Focusing on the value of a line of cosmetics
* B. Emphasizing a 100,000-mile car warranty
* **C. Associating an artificial sweetener with sugar**
* *D. Communicating a resort's luxury services*

It's an artificial sweetener that is just as good as "the real stuff". 
Their sweetener is in a class of it's own, better than sugar in the health but still just as sweet.

55. An interviewer should carefully monitor his/her tone of voice, facial expressions, and gestures when collecting marketing data from respondents to

* **A. avoid appearing biased.**
* B. limit the length of the interview.
* *C. discourage inappropriate responses.*
* D. dominate the conversation.

Bias is the most important thing in data collection.
Inappropriate responses can more easily be filtered out.

64. When identifying risks that a business faces, management should focus on the
   
* *A. probability of risk occurrence.*
* B. impact of the risks.
* **C. sources of the risks.**
* D. ability to transfer the risks.

The places that risk comes from are castly more important than how likely they are to occur, because if you know the source you can deal with the risk.

70. A business can help its salespeople build a clientele by

* *A. showing interest in the customers' needs.*
* B. following up with customers immediately after a sale.
* **C. having favorable adjustment and return policies.**

A and B are things that the saleperson has to do, D is irrelevant, and C makes the most sense: it's something that keeps customers coming and is the responsibility of the business.

82. Mason Publishing included the following statement in a newsletter that was sent to its sales staff about its new electronic reader: CEO Lucinda Marcelli said, "This product supports our ongoing efforts to revolutionize the ways in which students across the country learn." This is an example of

* *A. paraphrasing a comment to explain specific product benefits.*
* B. including a quotation to introduce an item during a sales meeting.
* **C. using a quotation to communicate product information.**
* D. summarizing the features of a new item by using a testimonial.

This kind of makes sense. It's a quotation, so the stuff after doesn't really matter.

84. Which of the following is an ethical issue that affects many businesses' product/service-management function:

* A. Using bait-and-switch tactics
* *B. Engaging in collusion*
* **C. Testing on animals**
* D. Setting unrealistic sales goals

Engaging in collusion is more of a legal concern I guess, in that it's outright illegal, while animal testing is legal but potentially an ethical issue.

87. The best way for salespeople to obtain detailed information about a complex product is by

* A. asking a customer who uses the product.
* *B. reading a product brochure.*
* **C. attending a training session.**
* D. conducting a product demonstration.

The way to get the most thorough information about the product is in person at a training session I guess.
